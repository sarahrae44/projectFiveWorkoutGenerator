# workout_app_frontend

A website based on a strength training anatomy book I have. Text taken from *Strength Training Anatomy* by Frederic Delavier

## User stories

User will see a sample of workouts on the home page* 

User will need to create an account to see more exercises/workouts*

User will be able to click on muscles/muscle groups to see which exercises strengthen them - muscle/muscle group tab, exercises tab

User will be able to click on an item in a list of exercises to see which body part(s) they strengthen

User can choose from a 15-20 minute workout or 30-60 minute workout and will receive a generated workout*

User can choose a workout focusing on chest/back, legs, core, etc*

User will be able to save exercises(s) to their account

## MVP features
Ruby on Rails project

Database will include muscles/muscle groups, exercises

## Stretch goals
Able to share via social media

User can create their own workout by choosing exercises

Add a stopwatch function

Add an image of the human body with 'hot spots' that will take user to various exercises that correspond with that part of the body (instead of via a list)

List of equipment needed

## Known bugs
Cannot delete user if exercises are saved under that user

Need to make it possible for user to delete saved exercises


## End of project reflections/improvements to be made
I'm able to delete an exercise/muscle in local host but not in the Heroku site(?) so will be updating that

I was able to set up users being able to add exercises to their profiles. Once I get the workout generator functionality working, they will be able to add those to their profiles

I will add pictures of exercises. Just ran out of time on that one

* Will be adding these with future enhancements
